Exercise:
Write a program that allows the user to win a prize depending on which number door they select.

Requirements:
Prompt the user to choose a numbered door between 1 and 5. Let them know which attempt this is. Users get three attempts, regardless of if they choose a valid number or win a prize. If the user chooses a valid door number, they win the prize behind that door. If they don’t choose a valid door number, they don’t win anything.

Use both a for loop and a switch statement in your solution.

Output should match the following examples.

Example 1:
Choose a door between 1-5 and win a prize! This is attempt #1: 1

Choose a door between 1-5 and win a prize! This is attempt #2: 2
