Exercise:
Write a program that can find the distance between two points, given the pointsâ€™ x and y coordinates.

Requirements:
Create a Point structure that holds the x and y coordinates of a point on a graph. Use properties to hold the data, and use the automatic properties syntax to define them.

Write a method that accepts two Point structures as parameters and returns the distance between them. The distance formula, given two points with coordinates at (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively, is
 distance =(x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 


Hint: Use the Math.Sqrt(number) and Math.Pow(number, power) methods to square root a number and raise a number to a power.

Output should match the following example:

Enter the x coordinate for point 1: 2
Enter the y coordinate for point 1: 4
Enter the x coordinate for point 2: 7
Enter the y coordinate for point 2: 9

The distance between these two points is 7.07
