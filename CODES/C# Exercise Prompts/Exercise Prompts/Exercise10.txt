Exercise:
Write a program that keeps track of the products in a businessâ€™s inventory.

Requirements:
Write a Product class that stores the name, price, and quantity of a type of product. The class should be responsible for prompting for input from the user and for displaying a print out of its data. The print out should include the total value that the business owns of that product (its price * quantity).

Write an Inventory class that stores all the products the business owns. The business organizes all of its products into a single inventory, so make this class static. The class should be responsible for displaying a print out of all the products and their info. The print out should include the total value of all products in the inventory.

Follow the principles of encapsulation by making all fields of both classes private.
