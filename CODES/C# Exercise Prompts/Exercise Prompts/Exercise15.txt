Exercise:
Write a program where the user enters the names of creative works and their writers, and then the program outputs that information.

Requirements:
Create an interface called IWritable that can be used with classes that represent creative works. The interface should define two methods - GetNameOfWork() and GetWriter().

In the Program class, write a method called PrintWriter() that accepts an IWritable object as input and prints out the name of the work and the writer.

Now, create three classes - Novel, which contains the fields name and author; Movie which contains the fields name and screenwriter; and Song, which contains the fields name and songwriter. Have each class implement the IWritable interface.

In the Main() method, prompt the user to enter the data for a novel, movie, and song, and store the data in those types of objects. Then use the PrintWriter method to print the writer info for each of the objects.

Output should match the following example:

Enter name of novel: Pride and Prejudice
Enter name of author: Jane Austen

Enter name of movie: La La Land
Enter name of screenwriter: Damien Chazelle

Enter name of song: Fallin
Enter name of songwriter: Alicia Keys
